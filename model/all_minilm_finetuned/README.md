from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Download from the 🤗 Hub
model = SentenceTransformer("sentence_transformers_model_id")
# Run inference
sentences = [
    'experienced professional skilled in development, pytorch, keras, left, crime, cloud, python, mlops. cell middle see live stage memory trade. support girl environment paper responsibility everybody view.',
    'ml engineer needed with experience in pytorch, tensorflow, cloud, mlops, python, computer vision. series economic ready. present idea theory pm strategy movement.',
    'a lawyer provides legal counsel and represents clients in court, ensuring that their rights are protected and advocating on their behalf. this role requires strong analytical and negotiation skills, as well as an in-depth knowledge of legal statutes and case law. you will handle a variety of legal matters, including corporate law, criminal defense, and contract disputes, tailoring your approach to the needs of each client. the position demands excellent communication skills, strategic thinking, and the ability to think on your feet in high-pressure situations. lawyers must also maintain a high level of professionalism and ethical standards.',
]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# [3, 384]

# Get the similarity scores for the embeddings
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[1.0000, 0.9663, 0.0338],
#         [0.9663, 1.0000, 0.0480],
#         [0.0338, 0.0480, 1.0000]])
